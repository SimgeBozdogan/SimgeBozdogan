## About

I'm a Full-Stack Developer specializing in building platforms that integrate software development, quality assurance, and business analysis. I work primarily with Node.js, Express.js, and modern JavaScript to create applications that help teams manage requirements, implement testing strategies, and make data-driven release decisions.

My work focuses on connecting technical implementation with business objectives, with a particular interest in AI-powered testing automation, requirement traceability, and risk-based release assessment. I believe that effective software delivery requires a holistic approach where code quality, test coverage, and business alignment work together seamlessly.

## Current Focus

I'm currently working on enhancing testing automation capabilities and exploring ways to make requirement-to-test traceability more efficient. My approach combines traditional software development practices with modern AI-assisted testing techniques to improve both development velocity and product quality.

I'm particularly interested in:
- Building intelligent systems that reduce manual testing effort through automation
- Creating tools that help teams make better release decisions based on concrete data
- Implementing workflows that bridge the gap between business requirements and technical implementation

## Expertise

**Full-Stack Development**
- Node.js, Express.js, JavaScript (ES6+)
- RESTful API design and implementation
- SQLite and relational database design
- HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript for frontend development

**Quality Assurance & Testing**
- Automated test generation and execution
- Regression testing strategies and implementation
- Flaky test detection and analysis
- Test result tracking and reporting

**Development Practices**
- Requirement management and traceability
- Code change impact analysis
- Release risk assessment
- API change detection and versioning

## Featured Project

### [Product Quality & Decision Platform](https://github.com/SimgeBozdogan/product-quality-platform)

A full-stack platform for managing product requirements, automated test generation, and release risk assessment. The system integrates requirement tracking, AI-powered test scenario generation, and data-driven release decision support.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, SQLite
- Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- Features: Requirement management, automated test generation, regression testing, API change detection

**Key Capabilities:**
- Centralized requirement tracking with user stories and acceptance criteria
- Automated test scenario generation from business requirements
- Risk-based regression testing based on code change analysis
- Release readiness assessment with business impact evaluation
- API change detection with impact analysis for dependent systems
- Test result history tracking and flaky test identification

**Why This Project Matters:**
This platform addresses a common challenge in software development: the disconnect between business requirements, testing efforts, and release decisions. By providing a unified view of the entire development lifecycle, teams can make more informed decisions about when to release features and what risks they're taking.

## Tech Stack

**Languages & Frameworks**
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js
- Express.js
- HTML5, CSS3

**Databases & Storage**
- SQLite
- RESTful APIs

**Tools & Version Control**
- Git, GitHub
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation

**Development Methodologies**
- Agile development practices
- Test-driven development (TDD) principles
- Requirement-driven development
- Risk-based testing approaches

## Development Approach

I emphasize clean, maintainable code and thoughtful architecture. When building systems, I consider:

- **Maintainability**: Code should be readable and easy to modify as requirements evolve
- **Scalability**: Solutions should accommodate growth in data and users
- **Testability**: Components should be designed with testing in mind from the start
- **User Experience**: Technical solutions should serve business needs effectively

I value clear documentation, consistent code style, and iterative improvement based on real-world usage and feedback.
